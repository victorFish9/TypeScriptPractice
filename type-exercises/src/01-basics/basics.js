// Define a type and an interface to represent a user profile.
// Include fields name (string), email (string), and age (number).
// (In reality we would only pick either the type or the interface and use that.)
// Change the above type, to that this works
var userType = {
    name: "John",
    email: "my@mail.com",
    age: 5,
};
// Change the above interface, to that this works
var userInterface = {
    name: "John",
    email: "my@mail.com",
    age: 5,
};

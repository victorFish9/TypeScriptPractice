# Type exercises

This repository contains type exercises for the TypeScript course at https://typescript-ohjelmointi.github.io/ (in Finnish).

Each subfolder in [src](./src/) contains a markdown file with an example usage of a specific TypeScript feature, and a TypeScript file, where you need to complete an exercise. Follow the instructions marked in the comments in the `.ts` files.

Note that in most exercises, the code may not "do" anything when executed. Instead, we will focus more on defining the correct types that are used in compilation phase.
